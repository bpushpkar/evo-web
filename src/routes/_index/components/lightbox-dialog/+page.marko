  <p>
    In traditional desktop operating systems, a lightbox dialog is a
    child-window that typically exists to communicate information to the user,
    display a prompt for input, or allow the user to verify or cancel an action.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whilst these specific cases are also valid and true on the web, we also see
    a wide variety of other custom uses. For example, a dialog itself might
    contain an entire full page-like experience, a video, image gallery,
    navigation or settings.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are various ways to visually present a dialog. The version here is the
    "lightbox" version. A dialog that visibly dims out the rest of the page
    while the dialog is open.
  </p>

  <p>
    The lightbox-dialog is fully responsive. On large screens it will be aligned
    to the center of the screen; on small screens at the bottom. Small screens
    display an additional "handle" button, used to expand the dialog height.

  <h2>Terminology</h2>
  <p>We use the following terminology when discussing this pattern.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>lightbox-dialog</strong>
      : the pattern as a whole, comprised of the following sub parts
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>parent window</strong>
      : the page containing the button that opens the dialog
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>dialog button</strong>
      : the button that opens the child window
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>child window</strong>
      : the overlay containing the dialog content
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>title</strong>
      : the title of the child window
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>modality</strong>
      : modal or non-modal, dialogs with a mask are always modal
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>mask</strong>
      : CSS effect that visibly dims out the parent window content
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>dismiss button</strong>
      : button that dismisses and hides the lightbox
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

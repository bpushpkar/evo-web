  <h1>Form</h1>
  <p>
    The purpose of a form is to collect data from the user, via one or more form
    controls. A classic example is filling out an address in an order form.
  </p>
  <p>
    Forms can submit their data to the server for processing
    <em>without</em>
    requiring any client-side JavaScript (triggering a full page
    refresh/load).
